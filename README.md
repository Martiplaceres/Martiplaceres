### My Last Projects:

#### :coffee: GO-LOYAL
For my Codaisseur portfolio I built my own app ‚ÄúGo-loyal‚Äù in one week where I built the entire full stack app from wire framing to implementation. The app digitize loyalty coffee stamp cards and it also keeps track of your sales and free coffees you gave as a store. The front-end is created with JavaScript, ReactJS, Redux and CSS, the back-end with NodeJS, an Express server, JWT & Bcrypt authentication and a PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM and otplib library for the QR code implementation.

  
GO-LOYAL repository: [GO-LOYAL](https://github.com/Martiplaceres/GO-LOYAL)
  

#### TINPET
This was our group project at Codaisseur. We coded this app in a group of 3 in less than 5 days. It's an app that works like tinder but for pets, it is an entertainment app which was the topic that we got assigned. In the front-end we used JavaScript, React, Redux,Chat Engine, firebase and Bootstrap. In the back-end we used Express server, JWT and Bcrypt authentication, PostgreSQL database with Sequelize ORM.
